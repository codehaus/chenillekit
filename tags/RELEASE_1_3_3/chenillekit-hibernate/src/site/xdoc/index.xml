                Hibernate is a powerful, high performance object/relational persistence and query service.
                Hibernate lets you develop persistent classes following object-oriented idiom - including association,
                inheritance, polymorphism, composition, and collections. Hibernate allows you to express queries in its
                own portable SQL extension (HQL), as well as in native SQL, or with an object-oriented Criteria and Example API.
            </p>
