Chenille Kit Private

  The ChenileKit-Private module let you have private pages which are accessible only to
  a user who has been previously authenticated (in some way).
  
  The authentication mechanism is let outside the scope of the library.
  
  The library needs to have a Bean (WebUser) as ApplicationState to recognize the user
  and his group and role properties.
