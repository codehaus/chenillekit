            <p>
                The ChenileKit Access module let you have private pages which are accessible only to
                a user who has been previously authenticated (in some way).
            </p>


            <p>
                The authentication mechanism is let outside the scope of the library.
            </p>

            <p>
                The library needs to have a Bean (WebUser) as ApplicationState to recognize the user
                and his group and role properties.
            </p>
