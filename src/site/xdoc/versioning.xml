        <section name="How chenille kit releases are versioned">

            <subsection name="Introduction">

                <p>
                    The Chenille Kit started life very early in the Tapestry 5 alpha cycle, with a simple name:
                    <em>Tapestry 5 Components</em>
                    (or<em>t5c</em>). Because of the radical changes that often occurred between
                    alphas a versioning scheme evolved that indicated which alpha release it was compatible with. For
                    example, Tapestry version
                    <strong>5.0.6</strong>
                    dictated a <em>t5c</em> version of<strong>0.5.6</strong>. Now that the project has taken
                    on a more solid identity, the versions will reflect the only the evolution of itself and not be tied
                    to Tapestry's.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Like Tapestry 5 (see
                    <a href="http://wiki.apache.org/tapestry/ReleaseNumbering">
                        <em>New Numbering</em>
                    </a>
                    ),
                    the Chenille Kit follows the versioning scheme as specified by the
                    <a href="http://apr.apache.org/versioning.html">Apache Portable Runtime Project</a>.
