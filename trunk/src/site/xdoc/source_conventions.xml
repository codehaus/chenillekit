            <subsection name="copyrights">

                <p>
                    The ASF copyright must appear on all Java source files. Technically it should appear on all
                    non-binary files in the repository.

                    As you make changes to files, update the copyright to add the current year to the list. The goal is
                    that the copyright notice includes the year in which files change. When creating a new file, don't
                    back date the copyright year ... start with the current year. Try not to change the copyright year
                    on files that haven't actually changed.

                    IntelliJ has a great comparison view: Cmd-9 to see the local changes, the Cmd-D to see the
                    differences. I whip through the changes (using Cmd-forward arrow) and make sure copyrights are up to
                    date as I review the changes prior to a commit.
